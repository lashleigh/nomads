Ashleigh and Benson's bicycling log.

If you want to play around with this project you should start
by learning about rails in general. This project is not a good
place to start learning about rails. It was my very first website
and I didn't write tests or comments anywhere. That said, it has
some neat aspects and I welcome anyone who wants to use it.

tl;dr

# clone or fork the repo
bundle install
# you may need to install ruby 1.9.3
# I like rvm, but rbenv is also popular for
# managing ruby versions

rake db:create
rake db:migrate

#start the rails server
rails s 

# open up http://localhost:3000/
# Log yourself in by clicking the sign in link and 
# supplying openid credentials. Now you need to make
# yourself an admin so you can write posts

# In the root directory type:
rails c

u = User.first 
# There shouldn't be any other users in the db yet
# If there are make sure you are giving yourself admin
u.admin = true
u.save

# Go back to the website and click on the posts tab, you should
# see a 'New Post' link. Click on it and supply some dummy content.
# Check the 'published' box at the bottom of the page and click save.

# You should be redirected to localhost:3000/posts/1-your-posts-awesome-title
# Notice the map to the right. Drag the icon around. The act of dragging the icon
# updates the location associated with your post. The first post defaults to Seattle.
# All subsequent posts default to your previous posts location. The asssumption
# being that you probably didn't bike very far in between postings and the last
# location is close to what you would want.

# Go to the map tab and check out your post being on the map. 
# Take a moment to try out leaving yourself a suggestion. 

# TODO
# extract and centalize configs
 - flickr
 - twitter
 - various consumer_keys

# maps fail to load when posts array is empty

# FIXED /openid/details not rendering correctly
# rails 3 has a different form_for syntax <%=

# FIXED RedCloth parsing problem by upgrading gem

# TODO icons
 - icon details are being pulled from the database
   so they much be imported for things to work right
